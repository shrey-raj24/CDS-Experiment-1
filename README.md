Aim -> Downloading and isntalling VS Code, (Hello World and Calculator Program).

Software -> Visual Studio Code

Theory -> C++ is a high level object-oriented programming language. It is also known as "C with class".
It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979.
It implements all the OOPs concepts.
It is a compiled language.
(A) To print an output in C++ we use cout command.
Syntax: cout<<value_to_print<<value_to_print;
(B) Basic arithematic operations like addition, subtravtion, multiplication and division can be performed.
To take input from the user, we use "cin" command.
Syntax: cin>>value_to_be_entered;

Code:
#include<iostream>  
using namespace std;
int main()
{ 
    cout<<"HELLO WORLD!";     
    return 0;
}
OUTPUT
(A)

(B)





Conclusion -> In this experiment, I learnt about C++ programming lnguage, its basic commands and also made a program for calculator.
